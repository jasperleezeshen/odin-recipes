            <h3 class="sub"> Steps</h3>
            <ol class="list">
            <li>Trim chicken of all excess fat, reserving fat.</li>
            <li>Place chicken, spring onion, 3 cloves crushed garlic, and one 1-inch piece ginger in a large pot. <br> Pour in enough water to cover. Bring to a boil; reduce heat to low and simmer, skimming any scum off the surface, <br> until an instant-read thermometer inserted into the thickest part of the thigh, near the bone, reads 165 degrees F (74 degrees C), about 1 hour.</li>
            <li>Pour enough reserved chicken broth into the pot to cover rice by half an inch. Cover; bring to a boil. Cook until rice is tender and liquid is absorbed, 20 to 25 minutes. Let rice sit, covered, for 5 minutes. Fluff with a fork.</li>
            <li>Serve garlic chile and ginger dips alongside chicken and rice.</li>
